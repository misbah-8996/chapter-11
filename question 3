#Q3
#For this problem, use the dictionary from the beginning of this chapter whose keys are month
#names and whose values are the number of days in the corresponding months.
#(a) Ask the user to enter a month name and use the dictionary to tell them how many days
#are in the month.
#(b) Print out all of the keys in alphabetical order.
#(c) Print out all of the months with 31 days.
#(d) Print out the (key-value) pairs sorted by the number of days in each month
import operator
#a
year={"jan":"31", "feb":"28", "march":"31", "april":"30", "may":"31"}
month=input("Enter a month: ")
for key, values in year.items():
  if month==key:
    print(values)

#b
sorted_year ={key:year[key] for key in sorted(year)}
print(sorted_year.keys())

#c
for keys,values in year.items():
    if int(values) == 31:

      print(keys)

#d
sorted_bydays = dict(sorted(year.items(),key= operator.itemgetter(1)))
print(sorted_bydays)
