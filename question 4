#Q4
#Write a program that uses a dictionary that contains ten user names and passwords. The
#program should ask the user to enter their username and password. If the username is not in
#the dictionary, the program should indicate that the person is not a valid user of the system. If
#the username is in the dictionary, but the user does not enter the right password, the program
#should say that the password is invalid. If the password is correct, then the program should
#tell the user that they are now logged in to the system.
