#Q8
#Using the card dictionary from earlier in this chapter, create a simple card game that deals
#two players three cards each. The player with the highest card wins. If there is a tie, then
#compare the second highest card and, if necessary, the third highest. If all three cards have
#the same value, then the game is a draw
