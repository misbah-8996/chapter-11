#Q5
#Repeatedly ask the user to enter a team name and the how many games the team won and
#how many they lost. Store this information in a dictionary where the keys are the team names
#and the values are lists of the form [wins, losses].
#(a) Using the dictionary created above, allow the user to enter a team name and print out
#the teamâ€™s winning percentage.
#(b) Using the dictionary, create a list whose entries are the number of wins of each team.
#(c) Using the dictionary, create a list of all those teams that have winning records.


a = eval(input("Enter Number of Teams: "))
d = {}
e = []
w = []
p = 0
for i in range(a):
  team_name = input("Enter Team Name: ")
  ws = eval(input("Number of Team Winning Games: "))
  d.update({team_name:ws})
  e.append(ws)
  w.append(team_name)

k = input("Enter team to check % of Wins: ")
for  i,j in d.items():
  if k == i:
    score = d[i]
    p = ((score/100) * 100)

print("\nYour teams list is {}\nWin Percentage of team is: {}%\nAll Teams with winning record: {}".format(d,p,w))
